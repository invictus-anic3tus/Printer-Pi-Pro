# Printer-Pi-Pro
The all-in-one Raspberry Pi hat for controlling your 3D printer!

The Printer Pi Pro is a Raspberry Pi hat plus a relay module. The hat controls things like servos, an accelerometer, a fan for cooling the pi, and more. It also controls a relay that can turn your printer on or off!

## What you need:
1. A Raspberry Pi (models 3+) running your 3D printer host firmware  
2. A 5V fan (If you want active cooling on your pi)
3. A solid-state relay (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GPB7N2T/) one, I'd recommend 40A, for turning off/on 3D printer)
5. The Printer Pi Pro PCB!
